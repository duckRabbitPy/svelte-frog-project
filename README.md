# svelte-frog-project

As much as I love frogs, I mainly developed this project as a playground for learning and understanding the core concepts of the Svelte framework. I learn best by building, and in the process I have explored reactive variables, stores, page transitions, component state and props in detail. I feel this knowledge and experience will be invaluable when I come to learn other popular framweworks such as React, Angular or Vue.
